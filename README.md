## Project Documentation

### Why did we build this project?

We built this api so many applications and users can have access to a list of schools and institutions in Northern Ireland.

### What problem was it solving?

This solves having to create a school table in every single application and adding the same code over and over again.

### How did we do it?

This is a dotnet core application which uses Mysql to store the school data, Entity Framework for data access and JWT to authenticate applications to allow them to use the api.
We have hosted this in the Gov UK PaaS Cloud foundry platform using Circle CI to deploy. This uses Swagger as a handy UI.

### Future plans

We may introduce a more advanced search if needed.

### Deployment guide

To run the databases you need mysql installed. Then run the below commands to set up the database:

- update-database

Restore the nuget package. Then to build run "dotnet build" in command line then dotnet run to run the site.
